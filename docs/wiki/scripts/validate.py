"""Validate an OKF (Open Knowledge Format) bundle against OKF spec v1 (see SPEC.md).

An OKF bundle is a tree of small markdown files: one concept per file, each with
YAML frontmatter carrying its provenance. Directory `index.md` files provide
navigation. This validator enforces the contract so a bundle stays machine- and
agent-readable.

Checks:
  1. Every non-reserved .md file has a parseable YAML frontmatter block. A YAML
     parse error is reported (commonly an unquoted colon-space or '#' in a
     string field; quote the value).
  2. Frontmatter carries every required key, non-empty. Through okf_version 0.3:
     type, title, description, source, verified, timestamp, tags. At 0.4:
     the same list with 'verified' renamed to 'verified_on' (see #6).
       - type     is one of the spec type vocab.
       - source   is a non-empty list of non-empty strings (provenance pointers).
                  An unquoted '#' in a block-style element (which YAML would silently
                  drop as a comment, losing the rest) is rejected. Quote it.
       - tags     is a list.
       - verified/verified_on parses as an ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD).
       - timestamp parses as an ISO date, or under okf_version 0.3+ as a full
                    ISO 8601 datetime (upstream OKF writes a datetime).
  3. Reserved filenames (index.md, log.md) name no concept and carry no
     frontmatter, except the bundle-root index.md may carry okf_version only.
  4. Internal markdown links resolve. Links must be relative. A root-relative
     ('/'-prefixed) link is rejected. Every link to a .md file inside the bundle
     must point at a file that exists; a link that escapes the bundle root or
     dangles is a hard failure. Optional link titles and <>-wrapped destinations
     are handled. The bundle is validated as one self-contained tree (to validate
     federated content, assemble the bundles into one tree and point --bundle at
     that root).
  5. No file leaks a secret VALUE (private-key blocks, cloud API tokens,
     secret=<blob> assignments). Credential concepts document key NAMES and
     paths, never the values. Heuristic; narrow a pattern if it false-positives,
     do not delete the rule.
  6. Optional upstream-v0.2 trust/provenance fields, checked for shape only when
     present (never required): 'generated' ({by, at}); at okf_version 0.4, the
     new 'verified' (a list of {by, at} confirmations, distinct from the
     required 'verified_on' at that version); 'sources' (plural; structured
     provenance objects, distinct from the required singular 'source'); 'status'
     (draft/stable/deprecated); 'stale_after' (an ISO date). A concept typed
     'Attested Computation' additionally requires 'runtime', 'parameters',
     'executor', and 'attester' to be present and correctly shaped.

Exits non-zero on any hard failure.

# Opt-in entropy scan (--secret-entropy-scan). The generic assignment pattern
# above uses a base64-standard value charset that excludes - and _, so a labeled

# charset would re-flag OKF key paths like `secret: svc/api/prod-key-path`, the
# precision an earlier review round asked us to keep. This optional pass instead
# matches only the base64url charset -- base64-standard values with `/` stay the
# generic pattern's job -- and keeps precision two ways. Structurally (the primary
# guard), the captured run must be a complete token: the trailing lookahead rejects
# a run that is followed by another value char (we truncated a longer token) or a
# `/` (it is a path segment, not a standalone value), so a documented key path like
# `secret: prd-usw2-...-key-path/service` cannot leak its first segment as a value.
# Excluding `/` from the class alone did not do this -- it stopped the match at the
# separator but still captured a >=24-char leading segment. Statistically, a
# Shannon-entropy floor backstops the slashless case: a random token scores above a
# short dictionary-and-separator name (measured: 24-char base64url secrets land
# ~4.05-4.4 bits/char, short human-readable names stay under 4.0). The floor is
# imperfect -- a long, varied slashless name can clear it, the acknowledged
# precision-for-recall tradeoff -- which is why the structural check, not this
# threshold, is the primary guard. It is off by default so a normal run keeps the
# narrow, zero-false-positive base64 behavior; the flag trades some precision for

    otherwise silently drop part of a provenance pointer.

    Quoting source elements is a hard SPEC rule, but YAML drops an unquoted inline '#'
    comment with no error: `- issue #445` parses to "issue", losing "#445". The parsed
    value alone cannot reveal the loss, so this re-parses the frontmatter into its node
    tree (which carries source position marks) and, for every top-level `source` element,
    checks whether a comment directly truncated a plain scalar (see
    _plain_scalar_dropped_comment). Delegating the lexing to YAML covers every shape (block
    items, single- and multi-line flow lists, wrapped scalars, quoted strings with
    escapes, anchors/tags, and block scalars) without re-implementing the parser. It is
    scoped to the top-level `source` key only (a nested `source:` under other metadata is
    not the OKF provenance list). A real parse error is reported by the schema check.

    `fm` is the safe_load result the caller already parsed. A `source` can enter it through
    a YAML merge key (`<<: {source: *r}`), a whole-node alias, an alias in key position, or a
    duplicate `source` key. Each materializes the field, but YAML keeps the LAST of duplicate
    keys, so the value safe_load returns is not necessarily the first clean `source:` the scan
    finds. OKF source must be one literal top-level list, so this requires the effective source
    to come from exactly one literal, unshared `source:` key and rejects every indirection
